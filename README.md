# Drinking-Game-App
## A CRUD express app for drinking games! _(I swear I'm not an alcoholic)_

#### Why?
I thought of making this app so that me and my friends would have a centralized location for all of the drinking games that we enjoy! In the process I found out that there were already many places like that on the web, but figured it would be good practice in making a CRUD app.

#### Wireframes!
Here are the screencaps for my wireframes. I have also included a link to the google slides presentation for it as well as the google sheets document for my database sructure.
