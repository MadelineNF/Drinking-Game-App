# Drinking-Game-App
## A CRUD express app for drinking games! _(I swear I'm not an alcoholic)_

#### Why?
I thought of making this app so that me and my friends would have a centralized location for all of the drinking games that we enjoy! In the process I found out that there were already many places like that on the web, but figured it would be good practice in making a CRUD app.

#### Wireframes!
Here are the screencaps for my wireframes. I have also included a link to the google slides presentation for it as well as the google sheets document for my database sructure.

#### MVP Features
This app allows you to upload new drinking games to the database, edit said games, and delete them. You can view individual games as well as a list of all games.

#### Post-MVP
I plan on eventually integrating a sort feature that allows you to view only games of a certain type. I also plan on remaking each game in JS and linking to them on each games page. I also plan on implementing a random game feature that will take you to a random drinking game when clicked.

### Potential Problems
In previous work I have had trouble with getting the views to render, while I do not expect to run in to this issue, this project gives me an opportunity to overcome it.
